### Listening: A presentation about food and culture

>
> 2 Where is Sofia from?
>
> 3 How many questions are there in Sofia's survey?



Hello! I'm Sofia. This afternoon, I'm going to tell you about the results of my survey. There were 20 students in my survey. My questions were on the topic of 'Food and culture'. I think this is an interesting topic. For example, I'm from Italy, and food is very important in my country and in my culture.

OK, so my first question was 'Where are you from?' and here are the results. You can see here that 50% of students come from England and 15% come from Spain. 20% of students come from Italy, like me, and 15% of students come from Egypt. So you can see that half of the students are from England.

OK, my second question was 'Is food important in your culture?'. The answers are interesting. You can see here that 'yes' is 70% and 'no' is 30%. That's six people! I was very surprised!

My third question was 'Are family meals important?'. That is, is it important to eat with your family? Again, I was very surprised because again 'yes' is 70% and 'no' is 30%.

My last question was 'Why are family meals important?'. You can see here that the results are interesting. There were two answers to this question.
