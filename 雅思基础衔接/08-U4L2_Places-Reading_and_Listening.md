### Reading: The Maldives

The Maldives are islands in the Indian Ocean. The islands are near Sri Lanka. The Maldives are famous for their good climate, beautiful beaches and warm seas. 

There are 360,000 people in the Maldives. Most people live on small islands. 

The capital city of the Maldives is Malé. It is a modern city with an international airport and a big harbour. 

People in Malé speak English and Dhivehi. English is useful because many tourists come here. 

Tourism and fishing are the most important businesses in the Maldives. Many people work in tourist resorts. Others work as fishermen or in fish factories. The currency is the rufiyaa.
