> Listen to a conversation. Try to think about three questions:

> 1 Are the speakers in a university? 
>
> 2 Are the speakers good friends? 
>
> 3 What is the conversation mainly about? 

> Good morning! Can I ask you …?
>
> Sorry, sorry, no time! no time!

> Excuse me! Do you have …?
>
> Sorry! Can't stop! That's my bus! 

> Excuse me! Can I have a few minutes of your time? 
>
> Uh, yes, sure. 

> Great! My name's April. I'm a student at the university and I'm asking people questions about their lifestyle. I'd like to ask you some questions – is that OK? 
>

> Really? 
>
> Yes. I feel happy when I do exercise. 

> Yes, I know what you mean. And when do you go to the gym? 
>
> Oh, every day. 

> Every day? Wow. OK, and what other things do you do to relax? Do you go to the cinema for example? 
>
> No, not really. I watch films on my laptop at home. 

> I see. And what about your friends? When do you go out with them? 
>
> Oh, well, I have some friends at the gym. But I also go out on Saturday afternoons. We go to a café and have a coffee and talk about … well, we talk about life, people we know, that kind of thing. 

> I think I know what you mean! OK, so …
