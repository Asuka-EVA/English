```
jack:Excuse me,can we get the bill?
waiter:Yeah,of course.And do you want the bill together or separate?
jack:Yeah,separate bills please.we're going to split it 50/50.
waiter:No problem.And how will you be paying? Do you need the machine?
jack:Yes.I'm going to pay with credit.
snow:same.
waiter:Okey,you got it.I will be right back with your bills.
snow:Am I supposed to tip?
jack:Yes,you should leave a tip.
snow:Okey,and how much should i tip?
jack:Well most people tip 15%.But ifyou think she did really well,then you can tip 20%.
snow:Now,because we paid on separate bills,do we like both have to leave a tip?
jack:yes, we both leave a tip.
snow:Okey,now what if i don't tip?
jack:so if you don't tip,then she's either going to think that she did something wrong.or she's going think that you're an asshole.
snow:what?why?
jack:Because tipping in North America is just basic etiquette.if you don't do it,then people are going to think that you're an asshole.
snow:Ugh.Okey,okay,okay.
