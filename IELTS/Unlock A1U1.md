我喜欢的足球运动员是梅西。他曾效力于巴萨罗纳足球俱乐部，这也是我最喜欢的足球俱乐部，同时内马尔也在这个俱乐部。2022年他曾带领阿根廷国家足球队，夺得世界杯冠军。梅西是唯一超越贝利和马拉多纳的世界第一足球运动员。同时我还喜欢巴西的足球运动员小罗纳尔多。

My favorite football player is Messi. He played for FC Barcelona, which is also my favorite football club, and Neymar is also at this club. In 2022, he led the Argentina national football team to win the World Cup. Messi is the only football player in the world who has surpassed Pele and Maradona. At the same time, I also like the Brazilian football player Ronaldo.
