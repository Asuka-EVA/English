Lecturer: Now, today I want to talk about megaregions. We're going to look at megaregions in different parts of the world, but first, we're going to look at this. Now, I have a map here. Where is this? Yes, Mehmet?

Lecturer: Yes, that's right. These are big cities. Um, here we have London at 'A', then here at 'C' is Paris and that one there at 'D' is Madrid. OK, now you see these two lines? The blue one here and the yellow one there? These show megaregions. Now, what does 'mega' mean?

Belis: Um, mega means 'big', 'very big'.

Lecturer: Yes, that's right. Thank you, Belis. So can you give me an example of a megacity?

Mehmet: Istanbul.
