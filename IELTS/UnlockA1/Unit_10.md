Steve: Hi! Good morning! Thank you for asking me here today. OK, so my name's Steve and I work for Transport for London. Today I'm going to tell you about the work we do and especially tell you about the electronic tickets we use in London.

OK, so what do we do at Transport for London? Well, we look after travellers in London. This can be people who travel in private transport or public transport.

Three million people travel in private cars and taxis and another five million use the bus, trains and, of course, the famous London Underground – the world's oldest underground train network. So that's a total of around eight million people.

Student: How old is it?

Steve: Sorry? What was that?

Student: How old is the London Underground?

Steve: Ah! Oh, uh it's more than 150 years old. It opened in 1863.

Student: Thanks.

Steve: That's OK. So, Transport for London started in 2000, and in 2003 we introduced the Oyster card system of electronic tickets. Before Oyster cards, people had to buy paper tickets. And that was OK when fewer people lived and worked in London. They could buy tickets for one journey, or for a day or for a month. But there was a problem – it was very slow.

Student: Why, how did people use tickets before?

Steve: Each passenger waited to buy a ticket and then they went to the gate. At the gate, they put the ticket into the machine, then the gate opened and then they took their ticket from the machine. Now, this wasn't difficult, but it took a long time, and more people started to live and work in London, so we wanted a better kind of ticket.

So what did we do? We needed a faster ticket system, and this was the Oyster card. It's an electronic ticket and it's very easy to use. You can pay for your journeys online and you can walk through the gates much faster. It's a great way …

Teacher: OK, so work with your partner. Five minutes!

Iman: Hi, hello. I'm sorry, what's your name?

Anna: Oh, I'm Anna.

Iman: Anna? OK, and I'm Iman. Can I go first?

Anna: Yes, sure. What's your topic?

Iman: Transport in cities: problems and solutions. OK, so I'm going to start with some facts about life in cities. The population of cities grows more quickly than in the countryside. This means that cities become really congested. This is because everyone uses cars to travel around the city, and this can be a problem.

For example, it takes a long time to get to your destination, so drivers need to use a lot of petrol, which is expensive and also causes pollution. What is more, being in a car for a long time can be dangerous because drivers suffer from tiredness. So, what is the solution?

Some countries said that bicycles would be a good idea and have free bicycles in the city for people to use. Another place where the government is working hard to improve the transport system is in Dubai. Firstly, the plan is to reduce traffic congestion by making public transport better, so they have introduced more buses and bus routes and also built a metro railway. But the problem is that buses get stuck in traffic jams, and commuters still have to drive to metro stations. So the plan for the future is to make the metro system bigger by going underground – like the London Underground – and also to go over the city with sky trains like they have in Bangkok. Also, because it is very hot in Dubai, they will build air conditioned sky bridges with travelators to connect the stations so that people can walk around easily and won't need to drive …

You can see in this photograph that this happened in Europe. A lot 
of companies used old ships. Old ships were cheaper, but they had 
some problems. For example, petrol came out of the ships and into 
the rivers. The petrol killed the fish. Fishermen were angry because 
they couldn't catch any fish.
```

```
So, was it a good solution? Well, that's a very interesting question!
Why? Because the companies weren't happy that they had to clean 
the rivers.
The old ships were cheap, but modern ships are expensive.
And they didn't want to pay to clean the rivers.
But there was some good news.
The fishermen are happier because the rivers are cleaner.
That means there are more fish than before.
I think it was a good solution.
