Dale: OK, so we need a place for our new office. What about here?
Hakan: Where?
Dale: The town centre. What do you think?
Hakan: Well, it's a good place. It's near some good roads. But … I don't think we should go there.
Dale: Oh? Why not?
Hakan: Because the buildings in the town centre are very old. They are cold in winter and hot in summer. They're not comfortable places.

2
Dale: What about here?
Hakan: The park?
Dale: Yes. It's quiet and it's not far from a big road. What do you think?
Hakan: Hmm, I'm not sure. It's quite far from the town. What about here? Near the train station?
Dale: The train station is good. It's good for travel … but I think we should go to the park. The buildings near the train station aren't cheap.

Hakan: Now what about the design? I think we should have big windows. What about you?
Dale: Yes, I agree. Big windows are good.

AW: What are your favourite home designs?
MC: I like Japanese designs. Many people in Japan 
build houses with unusual shapes. For example, the 
steep roof house. This house is very tall and has a 
steep roof. The windows on the roof are different 
shapes and sizes. Inside the house, the rooms are 
very narrow and the ceilings are very high. It is simple 
and very small inside.

AW: What do you think about 'green' homes?
MC: It is very important to build houses that are environ-
mentally friendly. My favourite green house is in Saigon, 
Vietnam. It is a 'garden home'. This house is in the middle 
of a busy city but there are plants everywhere. From the 
street, people see a tall garden. But in fact it is a house. 
There are plants and trees in front of the glass walls. There 
is also a small garden on top of the roof. You can put 
chairs and a table there and enjoy tea with your family.
```



```
AW: What are popular building materials?
MC: Wood is very popular. It keeps your house 
warm in winter. Many architects use wood, metal 
and glass. Sometimes they use unusual building 
materials. For example, one architect from 
Amsterdam put mirrors on every wall of the house. 
Other architects design houses with glass or even 
plastic walls.
