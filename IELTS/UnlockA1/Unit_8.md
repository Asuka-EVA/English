FACTS ABOUT FARMING

```
There are half a million farmers in the UK. This is about 1% of the 
population of the country.

Farmers grow fruit and vegetables and look after animals. They have 
to get up early to feed the chickens, cows and sheep. They sell milk, 
meat and other food to supermarkets in the cities.

Farmers are not rich. They have to spend money on their animals and 
on their farms. The supermarkets do not pay a lot of money for the 
food that they buy.

O'Connor: Thank you, thank you, everyone. Well, let's start, shall we? In my lecture tonight, I want to answer this question: 'How do we feed a city?' The question is easy, but the answer is difficult. And it's an important question.Why? Well, there are four important facts about cities that you have to know.First, cities don't have farms. True, some people have gardens and they can grow vegetables, fruit, etc. But not many people can do this.
There are many more people who can't grow their own food. So they have to buy it from supermarkets, from restaurants, etc.Secondly, people in cities are richer than people in the country. True, there are poor people in cities; sometimes a lot of poor people. But there are many people that have money, and these people eat a lot of meat. They eat more lamb, more beef and more chicken than people in the country.This is a big problem. Before we can eat meat, we have to feed the animals. This means that food for people becomes food for animals. And that means that food becomes expensive – rice, bread, vegetables – they all become more expensive.In some countries, poor people spend more than sixty per cent of their money on food.Thirdly, modern cities are big and they are becoming bigger. Today, 30 cities have a population of more than ten million people. In 2045, we are going to have more than 50 cities with a population of 20 million people … that's 20 million. Twenty.And the last fact. More than half the people in the world live in cities. In 2045, 75 per cent of people are going to live in cities. More people and more cities means bigger problems.So! What can we do about this? Well, I'm going to...

Sofia: Hello! I'm Sofia. This afternoon, I'm going to tell you about the results of my survey. There were 20 students in my survey. My questions were on the topic of 'Food and culture'. I think this is an interesting topic.For example, I'm from Italy, and food is very important in my country and in my culture.OK, so my first question was 'Where are you from?' and here are the results. You can see here that 50% of students come from England and 15% come from Spain. 20% of students come from Italy, like me, and 15% of students come from Egypt. So you can see that half of the students are from England.OK, my second question was 'Is food important in your culture?'. The answers are interesting. You can see here that 'yes' is 70% and 'no' is 30%. That's six people! I was very surprised!My third question was 'Are family meals important?'. That is, is it important to eat with your family? Again, I was very surprised because again 'yes' is 70% and 'no'is 30%. 
My last question was 'Why are family meals important?'. You can see here that the results are interesting. There were two answers to this question.First, 80% of people think family meals are a good place to talk. They think it's a good time for parents to see their children. Secondly, 20% of people think family meals are cheaper and healthier. They think that families cook fresh food and don't eat fast food.So my conclusion is that food is important in families and families are important in culture. Thank you! Any questions?
