Presenter: In half an hour, in 'Technology Today', we look at hovercraft in Alaska. But first, here's Kate Brand in our series on the animal world. In this week's 'Going Wild', Kate travels to Indonesia to meet some very special animals.

Kate: Now, it's noisy today because I'm in a jungle. I'm in the jungle in West Sumatra in Indonesia, and I'm here with Zaskia Basuki. Zaskia is a scientist and she knows a lot about the animal we're here to see today – the orangutan. So, Zaskia, what can you tell us?

Zaskia: Well, Kate, let me start with the name. In Indonesia and Malaysia, the word orang means 'man', and the word hutan means 'forest'. So 'orangutan' means 'the man in the forest'.

Kate: I see!

Zaskia: It's a good name for them, because orangutans are 'arboreal'. That means they live in trees. Here in Sumatra, they only walk on the ground when they have to. In fact, 90% of their life is in the trees. They're omnivores, so they can eat meat, fruit and vegetables, but they usually eat fruit. They're primates so—

Kate: Sorry, Zaskia ...

Zaskia: No, no, that's OK.

Kate: For the listeners at home, can you just explain 'primate'?
Zaskia: Ah, yes, well, a primate is a kind of animal that can use its hands to climb trees. Primates usually have a big brain, too.

Kate: Really? So are orangutans clever?

Zaskia: Yes, yes, they are very clever. They are good toolmakers. That means they can make things to help them. For example, they can use sticks to find food or leaves to make an umbrella. There's a famous video of one orangutan in the rain. He's very wet, so he uses some leaves to make a big umbrella.

Kate: That's great!

Zaskia: Yes, so they …
