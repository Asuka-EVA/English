Presenter: In half an hour, in 'Technology Today', we look at hovercraft in Alaska. But first, here's Kate Brand in our series on the animal world. In this week's 'Going Wild', Kate travels to Indonesia to meet some very special animals.

Kate: Now, it's noisy today because I'm in a jungle. I'm in the jungle in West Sumatra in Indonesia, and I'm here with Zaskia Basuki. Zaskia is a scientist and she knows a lot about the animal we're here to see today – the orangutan. So, Zaskia, what can you tell us?

Zaskia: Well, Kate, let me start with the name. In Indonesia and Malaysia, the word orang means 'man', and the word hutan means 'forest'. So 'orangutan' means 'the man in the forest'.

Kate: I see!

Zaskia: It's a good name for them, because orangutans are 'arboreal'. That means they live in trees. Here in Sumatra, they only walk on the ground when they have to. In fact, 90% of their life is in the trees. They're omnivores, so they can eat meat, fruit and vegetables, but they usually eat fruit. They're primates so—

Kate: Sorry, Zaskia ...

Zaskia: No, no, that's OK.

Kate: For the listeners at home, can you just explain 'primate'?
Zaskia: Ah, yes, well, a primate is a kind of animal that can use its hands to climb trees. Primates usually have a big brain, too.

Kate: Really? So are orangutans clever?

Zaskia: Yes, yes, they are very clever. They are good toolmakers. That means they can make things to help them. For example, they can use sticks to find food or leaves to make an umbrella. There's a famous video of one orangutan in the rain. He's very wet, so he uses some leaves to make a big umbrella.

Kate: That's great!

Zaskia: Yes, so they …

You can see their horns better in this photograph. The horns are very sharp!Oryx can run and jump very fast. Oryx eat grass and also fruit when they can find it.The oryx are nomadic. That means they do not live in one place in the desert, but they travel around.Thank you! Now, I think …

Sharks may be the most dangerous animal in the sea, but they are not the fastest swimmers. The fastest swimmers are sailfish. There are two kinds of sailfish. Atlantic sailfish (Istiophorus albicans) live in the Atlantic Ocean, and Indo-Pacific sailfish (Istiophorus platypterus) live in the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean.

IntroductionThere are about 10 million different kinds of animal on earth and they come in all shapes and sizes. This book is a simple introduction to the huge variety in the animal kingdom. It features some of the most unusual animals in the world and includes key data on each species and their habits in the wild.

Some of the strangest animals in the world live in Australia and New Zealand. There is the kakapo parrot (Strigops habroptila). It is a bird but it cannot fly. It is a nocturnal animal. It sleeps in the day and eats at night. There are only 131 kakapo parrots in the world.

The kiwi (Apteryx australis) is another bird that cannot fly. Some birds are very beautiful – but the kiwi is not. It is one of the ugliest birds in the world. But the kiwi is the most romantic bird in the world. Male and female kiwis live together for 30 years.

Australia has many strange animals. The most surprising Australian animal is the platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus). It has the face and feet of a bird, the body of a rat and the tail of a beaver. It is a mammal but it lays eggs.

The smallest mammal in the world lives in Asia. It is the bumblebee bat (Craseonycteris thonglongyai). It lives in Thailand. It is only 2.5 cm long and it weighs 3 g. There are only 2,000 bumblebee bats left in Thailand because people burn the forest where they live.
