Presenter: In half an hour, in 'Technology Today', we look at hovercraft in Alaska. But first, here's Kate Brand in our series on the animal world. In this week's 'Going Wild', Kate travels to Indonesia to meet some very special animals.

Kate: Now, it's noisy today because I'm in a jungle. I'm in the jungle in West Sumatra in Indonesia, and I'm here with Zaskia Basuki. Zaskia is a scientist and she knows a lot about the animal we're here to see today – the orangutan. So, Zaskia, what can you tell us?

Zaskia: Yes, yes, they are very clever. They are good toolmakers. That means they can make things to help them. For example, they can use sticks to find food or leaves to make an umbrella. There's a famous video of one orangutan in the rain. He's very wet, so he uses some leaves to make a big umbrella.

Kate: That's great!

Zaskia: Yes, so they …
