Presenter: In half an hour, in 'Technology Today', we look at hovercraft in Alaska. But first, here's Kate Brand in our series on the animal world. In this week's 'Going Wild', Kate travels to Indonesia to meet some very special animals.

Kate: Now, it's noisy today because I'm in a jungle. I'm in the jungle in West Sumatra in Indonesia, and I'm here with Zaskia Basuki. Zaskia is a scientist and she knows a lot about the animal we're here to see today – the orangutan. So, Zaskia, what can you tell us?

Zaskia: Well, Kate, let me start with the name. In Indonesia and Malaysia, the word orang means 'man', and the word hutan means 'forest'. So 'orangutan' means 'the man in the forest'.

Kate: I see!

Zaskia: It's a good name for them, because orangutans are 'arboreal'. That means they live in trees. Here in Sumatra, they only walk on the ground when they have to. In fact, 90% of their life is in the trees. They're omnivores, so they can eat meat, fruit and vegetables, but they usually eat fruit. They're primates so—

Kate: Sorry, Zaskia ...

Zaskia: No, no, that's OK.

Kate: For the listeners at home, can you just explain 'primate'?
Zaskia: Ah, yes, well, a primate is a kind of animal that can use its hands to climb trees. Primates usually have a big brain, too.

Kate: Really? So are orangutans clever?

Zaskia: Yes, yes, they are very clever. They are good toolmakers. That means they can make things to help them. For example, they can use sticks to find food or leaves to make an umbrella. There's a famous video of one orangutan in the rain. He's very wet, so he uses some leaves to make a big umbrella.

Kate: That's great!

Zaskia: Yes, so they …

Jason: Hi! How are you today? Good? Good! OK, good morning! I'm Jason, and today I'm going to tell you about a bird from my country – the American bald eagle. OK, so, where do they live? Well, you can see them in the US and Canada and here's a photograph of one.You can see here that this bird is flying to its nest. 'Nest' is the name for the place where the eagle lives. Some nests can be very big. How big can they be? Well, there was one eagle's nest that was more than 1,000 kilos!Here's another photograph. You can see she has these white feathers on her head.So what do bald eagles eat? Well, fish are their prey. That means the eagles hunt them. And you see her yellow beak here? That beak is very sharp. That means it can cut the fish very easily.OK, uh, and now Khaled is going to talk about an animal from his country.
Khaled: OK, good morning, everybody. My name's Khaled and I'm going to talk about the animal in this photograph here. So this is an Arabian oryx.An oryx is a kind of wild animal that lives in the desert. You can see them in many countries in the Arab world. For example, Oman, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and near my home in Abu Dhabi.They are famous for their horns. That's these two long, hard things on their head. You can see their horns better in this photograph. The horns are very sharp!Oryx can run and jump very fast. Oryx eat grass and also fruit when they can find it.The oryx are nomadic. That means they do not live in one place in the desert, but they travel around.Thank you! Now, I think …
