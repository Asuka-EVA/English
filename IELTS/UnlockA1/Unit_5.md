Professor: Now, uh, good morning, everybody. For this morning's lecture, we have with us Doctor Kate Hunter. She's an expert in sports science and today. She's going to talk to us about men, women and sport. That's right, isn't it?Dr Hunter: Yes, yes, that's correct.Professor: OK, so please can we welcome Doctor Hunter.Dr Hunter: Thank you, thank you. Can I just say that I'm very happy to be here with you this morning. I want to start with this question: Are men better than women in all sports?
Many people say 'Yes'. But is it true? Are they correct? And how do they know it's true? Many of my students, my male students that is, say 'Men are bigger and stronger than women. They are tougher and they can run faster – they must be better!'But these are opinions, not facts. There are in fact sports that women can do better than men. And this morning, I'm going to tell you about five of them.
Women have stronger backs than men. Look at this photograph of a woman's lower back. Women have three bones here but men have only two. This means that yoga is easier for women.OK, OK, there are some of you that think yoga isn't a sport. So let's look at the next photograph.Ah, tae kwon do! My favourite sport! Now, my research shows that women are better than men at tae kwon do. 'How?' I hear you ask. Well, women learn quicker than men. They are also faster. So, it's true that men are bigger and stronger, but they are not better than women in this sport.Student: But Doctor Hunter! Please can I ask you …
