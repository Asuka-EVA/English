FACTS ABOUT FARMING

```
There are half a million farmers in the UK. This is about 1% of the 
population of the country.

Farmers grow fruit and vegetables and look after animals. They have 
to get up early to feed the chickens, cows and sheep. They sell milk, 
meat and other food to supermarkets in the cities.

Farmers are not rich. They have to spend money on their animals and 
on their farms. The supermarkets do not pay a lot of money for the 
food that they buy.
```

O'Connor: Thank you, thank you, everyone. Well, let's start, shall we? In my lecture tonight, I want to answer this question: 'How do we feed a city?' The question is easy, but the answer is difficult. And it's an important question.Why? Well, there are four important facts about cities that you have to know.First, cities don't have farms. True, some people have gardens and they can grow vegetables, fruit, etc. But not many people can do this.
There are many more people who can't grow their own food. So they have to buy it from supermarkets, from restaurants, etc.Secondly, people in cities are richer than people in the country. True, there are poor people in cities; sometimes a lot of poor people. But there are many people that have money, and these people eat a lot of meat. They eat more lamb, more beef and more chicken than people in the country.This is a big problem. Before we can eat meat, we have to feed the animals. This means that food for people becomes food for animals. And that means that food becomes expensive – rice, bread, vegetables – they all become more expensive.In some countries, poor people spend more than sixty per cent of their money on food.Thirdly, modern cities are big and they are becoming bigger. Today, 30 cities have a population of more than ten million people. In 2045, we are going to have more than 50 cities with a population of 20 million people … that's 20 million. Twenty.And the last fact. More than half the people in the world live in cities. In 2045, 75 per cent of people are going to live in cities. More people and more cities means bigger problems.So! What can we do about this? Well, I'm going to...

Sofia: Hello! I'm Sofia. This afternoon, I'm going to tell you about the results of my survey. There were 20 students in my survey. My questions were on the topic of 'Food and culture'. I think this is an interesting topic.For example, I'm from Italy, and food is very important in my country and in my culture.OK, so my first question was 'Where are you from?' and here are the results. You can see here that 50% of students come from England and 15% come from Spain. 20% of students come from Italy, like me, and 15% of students come from Egypt. So you can see that half of the students are from England.OK, my second question was 'Is food important in your culture?'. The answers are interesting. You can see here that 'yes' is 70% and 'no' is 30%. That's six people! I was very surprised!My third question was 'Are family meals important?'. That is, is it important to eat with your family? Again, I was very surprised because again 'yes' is 70% and 'no'is 30%. 
My last question was 'Why are family meals important?'. You can see here that the results are interesting. There were two answers to this question.First, 80% of people think family meals are a good place to talk. They think it's a good time for parents to see their children. Secondly, 20% of people think family meals are cheaper and healthier. They think that families cook fresh food and don't eat fast food.So my conclusion is that food is important in families and families are important in culture. Thank you! Any questions?

Tea is tasty and good for you. It is also one of the most popular drinks around the world. But what is tea? And why is it so popular?
All tea comes from tea leaves but tea is not always the same. There are many kinds of tea. You can drink black tea, green tea, white tea or fruit tea. Each type of tea has a different taste and a different colour.

The history of tea begins in Asia. In China, Korea and Japan, tea is still very important today. In Japan, it can take many hours to prepare and drink tea with your guests. In Malaysia, a popular drink at breakfast is teh tarik ('pulled tea'). Malaysians say it is good for you and tastes good with canai bread.
Tourists in Kuala Lumpur like watching the tea sellers make 'pulled tea'. The tea sellers pour hot water on black tea. After five minutes, they add sugar and milk. Then they 'pull' the tea – they pour the tea from one cup to another many times.

In many countries, you must have a special kettle to make tea. People in different countries also like to add different things to their tea. For example, Russians use a special kettle called a samovar. They like drinking tea with lemon. Sometimes, they also drink tea with some sugar or jam.

In Turkey, tea comes in a Çaydanlık. A Çaydanlık has two kettles: one for the water and one for the tea. Drink Turkish tea with some sugar.
Arab tea, called karak, has cardamon, ginger, milk and sugar. In the United Kingdom, they add some milk and sugar. 

The British usually eat biscuits with their tea. In Japan, they like…
