The Coldest City in the World 

```
The temperature in your freezer is about -18℃. Yakutsk in Russia is colder than your freezer. In winter, the average temperature is -42℃!

In 2012, I visited Yakutsk. Why? Because I wanted to see the coldest city in the world. I wanted to meet the people of Yakutsk.

'Life is difficult in winter,' says Svetlana, 'but we're not sad.' Svetlana is the manager of a café in Yakutsk. She has two children. Her son Pavel is 11. Her daughter Daria is 5.

'The average temperature in winter is -42℃ . Some winters are colder. At -50℃, the kindergarten and the school are closed. Daria and Pavel are happy,' Svetlana says.

People in Yakutsk like sport. In spring and autumn, the average temperature is -21℃. They go skiing and ice-skating. In summer, it is warm. The average temperature is +20℃. They have picnics in the forests.
